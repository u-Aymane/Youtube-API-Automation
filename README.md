## YouTube - Unlimited API Requests

Youtube did a big mistake by not putting a Request Limit per account or per IP, by exploiting that we can get unlimited search data (videos_id, likes, dislikes...and much more), in the repository and add two usefull script

 - Getting all videos in a search QUERY
 - Getting all comments in all videos that you extracted with the script above

The script still BETA and it wasn't userfriendly, please if you have any issue let me know

## Understanding the YouTube API

Youtube use a very tricky method to track the next page, the don't use simple paging but they use Continuation Tokens eg. ```EuAEEgd5b3V0dWJxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx```, each token is related to a chunk of data

To break this we just need to supply this data to the same request we sent for the first part of data and  so on

P.S To get the first request ```page_number_1 = continuation = ""```

## Installation

Install requirements

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Setup

Before you start the scripts you have to update the COOKIES in ```variables.json``` to find the cookies follow these steps

 - Choose any video you want and open the Devtool in you browser ```CTRL + SHIFT + C```
 - Scroll into the comments until you see the next load of comments
 - Filter requests by next then choose the first one and scroll until you find cookies
 - Cookies are similar to this format ```VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=XXXXXX```
